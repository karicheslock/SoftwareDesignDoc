# SoftwareDesignDoc

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
For this software design document, the client was the Gaming Room and they wanted to take their Android-only game, Draw It or Lose It, and expand it to other platforms through a web-based application.  They wanted the software to be designed such that only one instance of a game could exist in memory at any given time, each game could have multiple teams, and each team could have multiple players.  They also wanted to maintain security of user accounts through a login requiring a unique username and password.


# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
This document clearly describes the use of object-oriented programming using Java including descriptions of encapsulation and polymorphism.  The use of Java for this applicationn works well given that it will be a web-based application with cross-platform compatibility.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Referring to the software design document was helpful in terms of keeping the client's requirments in mind and having the reference to go back to while developing the code.  The most useful part of the document was the UML diagram.  This served as a quick reference for the required aspects of the code that needed to be created, including all instance variables and methods as well as whether those variables and methods should be created as public or private.  It also clearly defined how the classes should be created within the overall package.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
