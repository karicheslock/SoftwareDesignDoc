# SoftwareDesignDoc

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
For this software design document, the client was the Gaming Room and they wanted to take their Android-only game, Draw It or Lose It, and expand it to other platforms through a web-based application.  They wanted the software to be designed such that only one instance of a game could exist in memory at any given time, each game could have multiple teams, and each team could have multiple players.  They also wanted to maintain security of user accounts through a login requiring a unique username and password.
